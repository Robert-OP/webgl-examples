# WebGL Examples

[WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) enables web content to use an API based on OpenGL ES 2.0 to perform 2D and 3D rendering in an [HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) in browsers that support it without the use of plug-ins. WebGL programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code (GLSL) that is executed on a computer's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background.
